2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][5]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][6]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin mult/U0/i_mult/gLUT.gLUT_speed.iLUT/NxM_mult.stage_1_add.stage_1_pipeline.s1_add_out_reg[0][7]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net Clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): mult/CLK, Clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
